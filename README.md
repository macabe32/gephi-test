Important. The files must be uploaded to a webserver (or run one locally) in order to be viewed. JavaScript security prevents running the pages locally without a webserver.

Once repo is cloned, go to your terminal and navigate to the directory where this project is located and start a webserve locally.

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Then navigate to localhost:8000 and open the index.html file.
